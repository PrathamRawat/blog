Yesterday was pretty productive, given it was our first day of serious work. I
finished a diagram for the database structure. I also laid some rudimentary
boilerplate code and a basic registration html and python.

recreated table which stores blogs. the new values are username, blogid, blog title, and blog content.
reasoning behind the change is ease of coding, as working with simple integer values to identify
a specific blog is far simpler than using timestamps. furthermore, it was decided a blog title column
was necessary.

also began creating functions to manipulate and retrieve data from the database. examples include
fetchUsername, fetchBlog, fetchAllBlogs, etc...
