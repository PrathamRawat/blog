  Finished component list and interaction page. We will have one python file which contains necessary functions, sitepaths, and db interaction.
  The other file will create the database and be run only once so that our database is consistent. We will have login, register, welcome,
  createBlog, blog, search, and showall html files. Each will be rendered by a different sitepath. At the moment, we plan on allowing Each
  user a single blog which is automatically displayed when they enter. in the future, we may adapt our code to incorporate multiple blogs for
  each user.

Yesterday was pretty productive, given it was our first day of serious work. I
finished a diagram for the database structure. I also laid some rudimentary
boilerplate code and a basic registration html and python.

recreated table which stores blogs. the new values are username, blogid, blog title, and blog content.
reasoning behind the change is ease of coding, as working with simple integer values to identify
a specific blog is far simpler than using timestamps. furthermore, it was decided a blog title column
was necessary.

also began creating functions to manipulate and retrieve data from the database. examples include
fetchUsername, fetchBlog, fetchAllBlogs, etc...

  Created basic.html for the use of flash inheritance in the future
  Created login.html: basic login page w/user and pass and login button. Also has a link to registration page
  Created welcome.html: basic welcome page to greet the user after they've been logged in

A lot of good basework today. I fully fleshed out the login logout mechanics and got
a bunch of people to generate data and help me test it out.

Created a flow chart that illustrates the user's experience on the site.
Started working on pages that allow additions to the database

alexT -- 2019-10-23 9:25pm
Created createPost.html, results.html, search.html
form in createPost which sends post title and content to welcome.html
form in search and in results which send input to /results to be searched for and sent back to results.html
cleaned up existing html
all html files ready for implementation of jinja
added sitemaps to make the website navigable in what we have so far

Enabled web page to display whether user or password are incorrect on login.
Once you successfully register, automatically redirects you to your new home page rather than making you log in again

alexO -- 2019-10-23 12:11pm
Discovered errors in delete functions and fixed them

alexT -- 2019-10-24 9:53pm
created branch addingJinja and htmlTest.py to test html files without effecting other code
cleaned up html code using <fieldset>. **Note that there is still no CSS fieldsets are html**
Created editPost.html: Very similar to createPost with a few minor changes
added and tested jinja functionality in welcome, results, and editPost
welcome gets a username variable and a posts variable. user is a string, posts is a dict
results is same as welcome. Both loop through the dict displaying all of the posts sent to them in an organized fashion
editPost gets the post content and postTitle so that it can be sufficiently edited.

alexT -- 2019-10-26 9:37pm
created search branch to work on search mechanism inside of "/results"
completed a basic search which searches through the titles of all posts and
sends a dict of posts whose titles contain the search input.
We will have to decide if we want to include post content in search.
results takes in the results dict and lists posts with a view button under each

alexO -- 2019-10-27 6:34pm
