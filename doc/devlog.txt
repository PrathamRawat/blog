  Finished component list and interaction page. We will have one python file which contains necessary functions, sitepaths, and db interaction.
  The other file will create the database and be run only once so that our database is consistent. We will have login, register, welcome,
  createBlog, blog, search, and showall html files. Each will be rendered by a different sitepath. At the moment, we plan on allowing Each
  user a single blog which is automatically displayed when they enter. in the future, we may adapt our code to incorporate multiple blogs for
  each user.

Yesterday was pretty productive, given it was our first day of serious work. I
finished a diagram for the database structure. I also laid some rudimentary
boilerplate code and a basic registration html and python.

recreated table which stores blogs. the new values are username, blogid, blog title, and blog content.
reasoning behind the change is ease of coding, as working with simple integer values to identify
a specific blog is far simpler than using timestamps. furthermore, it was decided a blog title column
was necessary.

also began creating functions to manipulate and retrieve data from the database. examples include
fetchUsername, fetchBlog, fetchAllBlogs, etc...

A lot of good basework today. I fully fleshed out the login logout mechanics and got
a bunch of people to generate data and help me test it out.
